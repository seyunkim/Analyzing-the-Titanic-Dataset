Analyzing the Titanic Dataset by running some Machine Learning Models

The purpose of this analysis is to use the train.csv dataset and train a machine learning model on the first 900 passengers on the Titanic Voyage to see what the likeliness that any given passenger was to survive. 

Using this trained model, the objective would be to predict whether the passengers in the test.csv dataset survived.

The datasets were retrieved from Kaggle. 

Thanks for looking.
